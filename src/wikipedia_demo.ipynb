Despite the efforts of Square to make unique games with 3D features such as Rad Racer and 3-D Worldrunner, and high sales, the company was in financial trouble. These events are what led to a final attempt at a breakout hit, Final Fantasy. Rad Racer appeared in a scene in the movie The Wizard. It was also one of three games, including Super Mario Bros. and Tetris, featured at the 1990 Nintendo World Championship with an exclusive racing level to complete as one of the rounds of competition.

       "| Due to most of Rad Racer's sales being from the United States, Rad Racer II was developed and released only in North America for the NES and the arcade. The sequel featured eight new tracks and new music but similar gameplay. Hardcore Gamer 101 said that steering was looser than the first game and rival cars more aggressive, leading to a less enjoyable playing experience. Despite the efforts of Square to make unique games with 3D features such as Rad Racer and 3-D Worldrunner, and high sales, the company was in financial trouble. These events are what led to a final attempt at a breakout hit, Final Fantasy. Rad Racer appeared in a scene in the movie The Wizard. It was also one of three games, including Super Mario Bros. and Tetris, featured at the 1990 Nintendo World Championship with an exclusive racing level to complete as one of the rounds of competition. The limited-edition release of the game's cartridge used in the tournament is now the rarest and most valuable Nintendo games available. | 0.8908036351203918 |\n",

IGN praised the early version of the game for its high draw distance and smooth frame rate. The game was built from the ground up to be a racing game for the Game Boy Advance and to take advantage of the hardware offered by the system. IGN previewed the game six months before it was made available for retail and called the graphics the game's highlight, while noting that tune-ups in the physics engine were needed before release. The game manipulated 2D sprites and backgrounds to give the impression of 3D to the player. By keeping the core graphics engine simple, the game was able to contain elongated draw distances and a smooth frame rate.</td>\n",

Gerstmann instead counted the latter as the game's greatest weakness, arguing that having to repeatedly play through the same courses with slightly different objectives makes the game excessively repetitive. He concluded that the game is far better than Mario Kart 64, but the repetitiveness \"ultimately kills it.\" Next Generation fell more in line with the majority, remarking that the combination of racing and adventure elements works well, and that \"Diddy Kong Racing shows Rare's pure craftmanship, displaying keen subtleties that eventually win players over.\"</td>\n",

Power Play's reviewer praised the MS-DOS version's variety. Vince Broady of GameSpot praised the \"excellent\" gameplay, but complained that the CD soundtrack is repetitive, and that the graphics were not as good as competitors. Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer complimented its \"terrific\" gameplay and praised the track editor, saying it was \"a tremendous idea\" and that it increases playability. Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus had mixed feelings: he believed the game is \"shallow as hell\", but also described it as \"surprisingly entertaining\". PC Zone's Charlie Brooker liked the graphics and sound, describing them as \"cute\" and \"neat\" respectively, and praised the game's \"timeless console-style action\". The game was named a PC Zone classic. A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that \"if you're just interested in simple, arcade-style racing that even runs fine on a 386, well, you've hit the mother lode\". He felt the game seemed designed more for consoles, since it is plainly focused on the multiplayer mode but lacks support for networked play, thus requiring the players to crowd around a single PC, but was pleased with the cuteness of the cars and the inventiveness of the tracks.</td>\n",

IGN gave the game two awards for portable games after its E3 2002 coverage: \"Best Graphics\" and \"Best Racing Game\". IGN praised the early version of the game for its high draw distance and smooth frame rate. The game was built from the ground up to be a racing game for the Game Boy Advance and to take advantage of the hardware offered by the system. IGN previewed the game six months before it was made available for retail and called the graphics the game's highlight, while noting that tune-ups in the physics engine were needed before release. The game manipulated 2D sprites and backgrounds to give the impression of 3D to the player. By keeping the core graphics engine simple, the game was able to contain elongated draw distances and a smooth frame rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 0.8628146648406982 |\n",

GamePro gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for sound and a perfect 5.0 in control, graphics, and fun factor, calling it \"a feverishly fun Nintendo 64 racer that combines elements of Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, and Pilotwings 64 into one spectacular game.\" EGM named it \"Game of the Month\", with its four reviewers lauding the challenging gameplay and numerous objectives to tackle. Gerstmann instead counted the latter as the game's greatest weakness, arguing that having to repeatedly play through the same courses with slightly different objectives makes the game excessively repetitive. He concluded that the game is far better than Mario Kart 64, but the repetitiveness \"ultimately kills it.\" Next Generation fell more in line with the majority, remarking that the combination of racing and adventure elements works well, and that \"Diddy Kong Racing shows Rare's pure craftmanship, displaying keen subtleties that eventually win players over.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 0.8548850417137146 |\n",
       "| Similar compliments were made of the other versions. A reviewer from Consoles + praised the SNES version's simultaneous four-player function and the addition of game modes and tracks. Joypad 's reviewer praised the multiplayer, saying it is \"simply excellent\", and gave the vehicles' manoeuvrability a similar description. Power Play's reviewer praised the MS-DOS version's variety. Vince Broady of GameSpot praised the \"excellent\" gameplay, but complained that the CD soundtrack is repetitive, and that the graphics were not as good as competitors. Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer complimented its \"terrific\" gameplay and praised the track editor, saying it was \"a tremendous idea\" and that it increases playability. Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus had mixed feelings: he believed the game is \"shallow as hell\", but also described it as \"surprisingly entertaining\". PC Zone's Charlie Brooker liked the graphics and sound, describing them as \"cute\" and \"neat\" respectively, and praised the game's \"timeless console-style action\". The game was named a PC Zone classic. A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that \"if you're just interested in simple, arcade-style racing that even runs fine on a 386, well, you've hit the mother lode\". He felt the game seemed designed more for consoles, since it is plainly focused on the multiplayer mode but lacks support for networked play, thus requiring the players to crowd around a single PC, but was pleased with the cuteness of the cars and the inventiveness of the tracks. | 0.8515068888664246 |\n",

The title became well known for being one of two titles from Square that made use of stereoscopic 3D, which was made possible by wearing a pair of anaglyph glasses. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto initially conceived the game as an opportunity for developer Nasir Gebelli to demonstrate his 3D programming skills.

In this game, players drive a Ferrari 328 or a generic Formula One racing machine through a racecourse. The game was released in North America and Europe months after its debut. The title became well known for being one of two titles from Square that made use of stereoscopic 3D, which was made possible by wearing a pair of anaglyph glasses. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto initially conceived the game as an opportunity for developer Nasir Gebelli to demonstrate his 3D programming skills. Gebelli developed, and often drew by hand, the graphics for the game's 3D mode. | 0.886330246925354  |\n",

While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from Super Mario Kart has remained intact. The first sequel, Mario Kart 64, was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 and was the first Mario Kart game to feature fully 3D graphics. Although reviewers including IGN and GameSpot felt that the single-player gameplay was lacking compared to its predecessor, the simultaneous four-person multiplayer modes – a first for the Nintendo 64 – were praised. The second sequel, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It was described by GameSpot as more of a remake of Super Mario Kart than a sequel to Mario Kart 64 and featured a return to the graphical style of the original. As well as featuring new tracks, players are able to unlock the original SNES tracks if certain achievements are completed. Mario Kart: Double Dash was released for the GameCube in 2003. Unlike any other Mario Kart game before or since, it features two riders in each kart, allowing for a new form of cooperative multiplayer where one player controls the kart's movement and the other fires weapons. Mario Kart DS, released for the Nintendo DS in 2005, was the first Mario Kart game to include online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. It went on to become the best selling handheld racing game of all time, selling 7.83 million units. The game marks the debut of tracks appearing in previous games. Mario Kart Wii was released for the Wii in 2008 and incorporates motion controls and 12-player racing. Like Mario Kart DS, it includes online play; it allows racers to play as user-created Miis as well as Mario series characters and comes packaged with the Wii Wheel peripheral, which can act as the game's primary control mechanism when coupled with a Wii Remote. Mario Kart Wii went on to be the worldwide best-selling game of 2008. Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011, which features racing on land, sea, and air. Mario Kart 7 added the ability to customize the kart and to race in first-person mode. Three Mario Kart arcade games have been released, Mario Kart Arcade GP in 2005, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 in 2007, and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX in 2013. All of them were developed jointly by Nintendo and Namco and feature Namco characters including Pac-Man and Blinky. The most recent entry in the series is Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, which was released at the end of May 2014, which brings back gliders and propellers from Mario Kart 7 as well as 12-player racing in Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 includes a new feature called Mario Kart TV, where players can watch highlights of previous races and uploading them to YouTube. Another new feature is anti-gravity racing, where players can race on walls and ceilings. An enhanced port, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, was released on the Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2017. The game keeps most elements from the Wii U version, while adding more characters, kart parts, battle modes, and battle stages. The port received universal critical acclaim, and has sold over 20 million copies as of August 2020, becoming the best selling game for the console.</td>\n",

       "| 1125899906848375 | Several sequels to Super Mario Kart have been released for successive generations of Nintendo consoles, each receiving commercial success and critical acclaim. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from Super Mario Kart has remained intact. The first sequel, Mario Kart 64, was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 and was the first Mario Kart game to feature fully 3D graphics. Although reviewers including IGN and GameSpot felt that the single-player gameplay was lacking compared to its predecessor, the simultaneous four-person multiplayer modes – a first for the Nintendo 64 – were praised. The second sequel, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It was described by GameSpot as more of a remake of Super Mario Kart than a sequel to Mario Kart 64 and featured a return to the graphical style of the original. As well as featuring new tracks, players are able to unlock the original SNES tracks if certain achievements are completed. Mario Kart: Double Dash was released for the GameCube in 2003. Unlike any other Mario Kart game before or since, it features two riders in each kart, allowing for a new form of cooperative multiplayer where one player controls the kart's movement and the other fires weapons. Mario Kart DS, released for the Nintendo DS in 2005, was the first Mario Kart game to include online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. It went on to become the best selling handheld racing game of all time, selling 7.83 million units. The game marks the debut of tracks appearing in previous games. Mario Kart Wii was released for the Wii in 2008 and incorporates motion controls and 12-player racing. Like Mario Kart DS, it includes online play; it allows racers to play as user-created Miis as well as Mario series characters and comes packaged with the Wii Wheel peripheral, which can act as the game's primary control mechanism when coupled with a Wii Remote. Mario Kart Wii went on to be the worldwide best-selling game of 2008. Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011, which features racing on land, sea, and air. Mario Kart 7 added the ability to customize the kart and to race in first-person mode. Three Mario Kart arcade games have been released, Mario Kart Arcade GP in 2005, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 in 2007, and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX in 2013. All of them were developed jointly by Nintendo and Namco and feature Namco characters including Pac-Man and Blinky. The most recent entry in the series is Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, which was released at the end of May 2014, which brings back gliders and propellers from Mario Kart 7 as well as 12-player racing in Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart 8 includes a new feature called Mario Kart TV, where players can watch highlights of previous races and uploading them to YouTube. Another new feature is anti-gravity racing, where players can race on walls and ceilings. An enhanced port, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, was released on the Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2017. The game keeps most elements from the Wii U version, while adding more characters, kart parts, battle modes, and battle stages. The port received universal critical acclaim, and has sold over 20 million copies as of August 2020, becoming the best selling game for the console. | 0.9143435597419738 | 0.9240285158157349 | 0.8917453289031982 |\n",

They did not decide to incorporate Mario characters until a few months into development. The choice was made after the development team when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0.9069618225097655 | 0.8670883178710938 |        1.0         |\n",
